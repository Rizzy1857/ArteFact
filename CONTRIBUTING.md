# Contributing to ArteFact

First of all, thank you for considering contributing! ðŸŽ‰

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork** the repository.
2. **Create a branch** for your feature or bugfix.
3. **Write your code** with clear structure and docstrings.
4. **Write tests** in the `tests/` directory.
5. **Submit a Pull Request** and describe what your changes do.

## Code Style

- Use **PEP8** for Python code.
- Follow **modular structure** â€“ don't jam everything in one file.
- Name scripts descriptively: `file_carver.py`, not `script1.py`.

## Testing

- Include sample inputs under each module's `test_files/`, `test_dumps/`, etc.
- Use `pytest` for writing unit tests.

## Reporting Issues

If you find a bug or want to suggest a feature:
- Open an [issue](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ArteFact/issues).
- Include logs, screenshots, or examples if possible.

Let's keep the code sharp and the docs sharper.
